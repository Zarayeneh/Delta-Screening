// Delta-screening, dynamic community detection 
//
// This work is an extension of the Louvain implementation 
// for static community detection. The change incorporates
// the Delta-screening technique that selects subsets of 
// vertices to process at each iteration.
//
// The Louvain implementation for static community detection is 
// based on the article 
// "Fast unfolding of community hierarchies in large networks"
// Copyright (C) 2008 V. Blondel, J.-L. Guillaume, R. Lambiotte, E. Lefebvre

// And based on the article 
// "A Generalized and Adaptive Method for Community Detection"
